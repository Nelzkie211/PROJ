removed all the .git folders from the sub folders as well as from root.

git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M master (if you are committing from the branch switch to branch)
git remote remove origin (if you have any)
git remote add origin https://github.com/abcd1234/xxxxxxx.git
git push -u origin master






(1) rm -rf .git/

(2) git init

(3) git remote add origin https://repository.remote.url 1.6k

(4) git commit -m “Commit message”

(5) git push -f origin master

Note that all git configs like remote repositories for this repository are cleared in step 1. So, you have to setup all remote repository URLs again.

Also, take care of the -f in step 5 : The remote already has some code base with n commits, and you’re trying to make all those changes into a single commit. So, force-pushing the changes to remote is necessary.
